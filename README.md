# Molecular Collision Simulation

This JS package enables the simulation of particles moving in a client-specified 2D-space. The *CollisionSystem.js* script has to be loaded as a module; it will expose a constructor at window.CollisionSystem. Drawing an instance by providing the constructor an **svg id** and a **number of particles** will start the system. 

## API
- *CollisionSystem(id, n)*: [constructor] id must be the id of a rectangular svg element, with specified height and width. n is the number of particles to be created in the system.
- *simulate()*: increments the time by one.
- *addParticle(type, x, y, size)*: add a particle in the 2D-space. 1 is the minimal size, 3 the maximal size. 
- *removeParticle(id)*: remove the refered particle.

## Interaction
The package comes with build in interactions:
- *click on particle*: will delete the particle
- *click on system*: wil add a particle if possible (no overlapping with other particles).

## Collision System in action
The system starts with a big particle, called molecule here, surrounded by small particles, called atoms. By keeping simulating the system, you can observe the random walk of the molecule.

Click on some atoms an create a low pressure atmosphere.

If your interested in high pressure gas, add some atoms by clicking in the system.
