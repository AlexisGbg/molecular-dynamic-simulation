# Molecular Collision Simulation

This JS package enables the simulation of particles moving in a client-specified 2D-space. The *CollisionSystem.js* script has to be loaded as a module; it will expose a constructor at window.CollisionSystem. Drawing an instance by providing the constructor an **svg id** and a **number of particles** will start the system. 

## API
- *CollisionSystem(id, n)*: [constructor] id must be the id of a rectangular svg element, with specified height and width. n is the number of particles to be created in the system.
- *simulate()*: increments the time by one.
- *addParticle(type, x, y, size)*: add a particle in the 2D-space. 1 is the minimal size, 3 the maximal size. 
- *removeParticle(id)*: remove the refered particle.

## Interaction
The package comes with build in interactions:
- *click on particle*: will delete the particle
- *click on system*: wil add a particle if possible (no overlapping with other particles).
